# Welcome to the CLL LABs Github!

We use Github for (1) code collaboration and (2) project management. 

1. For code collaboration, the intended use is the same as it is with any other Github repository. 
2. For project management, we have *Projects* for each topic of interest in the group.

### Current Projects

| Project Name      | Description | 
| :---        |    :----:   |
| General      | General questions, discussions, and coordination |
| Coding   | Questions, tips and tricks for coding|
| Research Projects   | Discussions regarding a particular research project|
| DALY-CARE   | Discussions regarding the DALY-CARE database and package|

## How to use Github for Project Management
In each of the projects listed above, one can add an *Issue* and tag the relevant people. Tagging is done using the syntax "@RH-CLL-LAB/your_tagged_team" to tag an entire team or simply "@your_tagged_team_member". By tagging them, they will receive an email that you have tagged them in this particular issue on Github. Once they are tagged, subsequent comments and messages will also notify the team members. If the particular thread is no longer relevant, one can always *unsubscribe* to a thread. This will disable any emails sent to you by Github for that particular thread. 
Issues are categorized as *To-do*, *In Progress* or *Done*. Use these categories to indicate at what stage an issue is. This helps us keep tabs on what issues are active and need our attention. 
All the issues are stored in the project, and can therefore be searched for if needed.

## What to avoid
Under no circumstances can you provide **any** ID that is unique to a patient in an issue.
